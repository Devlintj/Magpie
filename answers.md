##Question 1: can I identify key Words?
###The way to identify them would be to see if the same word get's the same response. This is what I have done.

##Question 2:Think of keywords and what response they might cause.
###some of Chat with Zog's keywords are:
####saying 'yes and no' gets it in a loop of asking a series of questions
####Zog will realize when you type the same thing over several times and tell you to say something else.
####'fun' makes him say something about barrels of fun
####a '?' will make him ask if you wrote a complex sentence.
####'aliens' will make zog ask what you want to know.
####'fox news' will make zog say they're the worst on the planet.
####typing nonsense confuses zog.
####zog responds negatively to the word "kill"
####asking about zog's language makes him say the language is so complex, even his species can't speak it.
####asking what he looks like makes him responds, "like an alien"
####saying nice words like 'nice', and 'pretty' will make him respond back kindly
####saying the word go makes zog say bye
####asking about children will make zog tell you it has had lots of children.
