##Question 1: What happens when a keyword appears in another word?
###It seems the bot will respond to a keyword even if it's only letters of a bigger word. The problem with this is that different words have different meaning, so if the chatbot can't tell no from know the chatbot will not be able to communicate well.
##not a question but it asked to explain how code deals with multiple keywords.
###The code responds to the first keyword triggered in the sequence of else if statements. IE if "no" is a keyword that get's checked before "mother", even if mother is the first word in the sentence, "Today, mother told me no", the "no" response will be triggered.
